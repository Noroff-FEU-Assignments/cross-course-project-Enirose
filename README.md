## Description
This is my first ever project. We were given a task to choose what to build and i pick the e-commerce website selling jackets. It's called Rainydays. We started with UI/UX design. We used Adobe xd to design a prototype for our website. Where we can have an overview of what or how we want our webiste to be. Then we after i finalized my design, I started with HTML and CSS. It was all plain HTML and CSS from the start. but later on we added wordpress and javascript.
